# SmartShopper

## Purpose
#### The purpose of SmartShoper is to allow users to keep track of grocery goods they buy. Smart Shopper is a simplified version grocery tracker and allows for use inside supermarkets since it does not require internet connection for it to run.

## Functionality
#### SmartShopper allows users create list and add or delete grocery goods from it. Upon adding new product users can view the history of current as well as previous lists. To further personalize user's experience, optional attributes have been added such as enter price, expiration date, as well as check off items they own. Upon adding new items, user is also able to add recommended products (receommended products come from current/previously created lists).
