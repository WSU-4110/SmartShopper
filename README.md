**SmartShopper**

## Search Bar

#### Installation

In order for the search bar to work on another device, a few things need to be downloaded...

If you just take what is in App.js, then you need to download the appropriate search bar and install it either globally or locally.
``` bash
npm install --save react-native-multiple-select-list
```
The necessary import in App.js
``` bash
import CustomMultiPicker from "react-native-multiple-select-list";
```

An alternative route is to import the packages that are in the package.json file, but if you only want the one necessary line, then you can add the following line in the dependecies section of package.json
``` bash
"react-native-multiple-select-list": "^1.0.4"
```
